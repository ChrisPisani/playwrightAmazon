# Amazon.com E2E Testing Project

This project implements automated end-to-end (E2E) testing of Amazon.comâ€™s search and filtering features, as well as category navigation flows, using the Playwright testing framework. It applies input domain modeling and graph-based testing techniques to ensure robust coverage of key user interactions.
